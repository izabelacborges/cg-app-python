# Computer Graphics App

> This is an assignment for my Computer Graphics class and I'll be implementing the DDA, Bresenham's, Parametric Equation, Circumference, Translation, Scaling, Rotation and Cropping algorithms.

This app is being made with python 3.6.1, and tkinter.

## Setup

You should install Python 3.6.x

For Windows OS do it by clicking [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For Linux systems, verify if your system already has python 3.6 installed by typing `python --version` and `python3 --version` on your terminal. If not, do it by folowing the next steps:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

Verify the installation success by typing `python3 --version` again. Any problems with installation, follow the steps on my python introductory course [here](https://github.com/izabelacborges/python-bootcamp-minicourse/blob/master/setup-install/install-linux.md).

## Run

Clone my repository to your computer by doing a `git clone`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/izabelacborges/cg-app-python.git
```

And when on the root directory for my project, execute `python3 main.py` on your terminal.
